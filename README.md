# Movie Interaction Platform ðŸŽ¬

Welcome to our simple yet dynamic web application built using Laravel, which allows users to interact with various movies. The users can express their thoughts about the movies, engage with the community by liking or disliking comments, and even contribute by adding new movies.

The platform also ensures secure authentication at multiple levels, linking each action to its corresponding authenticated user. Only the user who created a post or an administrator can modify or delete that post.

## Core Features ðŸŒŸ

Here are some use-cases that illustrate the primary features of our website:

Its a simple website built in laravel that allows users to add movies. Users can comment their thought on any added movies, like or dislike the already added comments. This websit allows authentivation at multiple levels. Each task is associated with the authenticated user. For instance a post can be only deleted or updated only by the user that added or by the admin.
